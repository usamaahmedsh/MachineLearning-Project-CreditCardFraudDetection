Final project
=============

This repository contains the template for the final project writeup. It is a
modified version of the NeurIPS 2024 template (https://neurips.cc).

In the `final_project.tex` file, copy over the content from your introduction
and methods drafts (with appropriate changes to address feedback), and fill in
the results and discussion sections when the time comes (don't forget to push!).

Your final project report should be a coherent document, so make sure to update
your introduction and methods if your ideas have changed since you submitted
drafts of those sections.

Add your code to the `code` directory, and your data to the `data` directory
(if the data is not sensitive and is <100 MB in size). We will check for
reproducibility (i.e., try to run the code ourselves) whenever it is reasonable
to expect it.

We will also look at your code to see if it is well organized and documented.
